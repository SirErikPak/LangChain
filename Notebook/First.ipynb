Believed by ancient scholars to bridge the earthly realm with the ethereal, these plants radiate a soft luminescence, guiding lost travelers through the darkest nights. Mystics and poets claim that merely being in the presence of Luminaflora can soothe troubled thoughts and illuminate the path to inner peace.   The roots of Luminaflora Spiralis are as intriguing as its blooms. Entwining deeply within the earth, they seek not water, but moonlight that filters through the soil, a phenomenon that baffles even the most learned botanists. The plant's affinity for lunar rays is reflected in its growth cycle, with each phase of the moon bringing about subtle changes in its luminescence and petal orientation. This unique symbiosis with the moon makes Luminaflora a subject of endless fascination.  In medicinal practices, extracts from Luminaflora Spiralis are highly valued for their illuminating properties. Alchemists concoct potions that harness the plant's glow, claiming such elixirs can light up one's inner darkness, dispelling\")"

    "Here's a breakdown of the differences between `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`, and `bert-base-nli-mean-tokens`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\t\n",
    "    - General-purpose. The modern standard.\tSmallest & fastest.\tExcellent for its size. \n",
    "    - The recommended default. `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2` Paraphrase-focused. Very similar to `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. Excellent, but specifically for finding paraphrases. `bert-base-nli-mean-tokens` Legacy. An older, foundational model.\tLarger & slower. Good, but generally outperformed by newer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed Breakdown\n",
    "1. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`: This is the most popular and highly recommended model for most general tasks.\n",
    "- Training and Purpose: The \"all-\" prefix means it was trained on a massive, diverse dataset of over 1 billion sentence pairs from various sources. This makes it a great \"all-arounder\" that performs well on a wide range of tasks, including semantic search, clustering, and sentence similarity.\n",
    "- Architecture & Efficiency: The `MiniLM-L6-v2` part tells you about its architecture. It's a \"distilled\" model, meaning it's a smaller version of a much larger, more complex model. It has 6 layers and outputs a 384-dimensional vector. This distillation process allows it to be extremely fast and lightweight while retaining very high-quality embeddings.\n",
    "- When to use it: This should be your go-to choice unless you have a specific reason to use something else. It's the best balance of speed, size, and performance for most applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`: This model is a close cousin to all-MiniLM-L6-v2 but with a slightly different specialization.\n",
    "- Training and Purpose: This model was specifically fine-tuned on a dataset of paraphrases (like Quora question pairs and other sentence pairs that express the same meaning in different ways). This training makes it exceptionally good at identifying semantic similarity, even when the sentences use completely different words.\n",
    "- Architecture & Efficiency: It shares the same efficient `MiniLM-L6-v2` architecture, so it's also very fast and has the same 384-dimensional output.\n",
    "- When to use it: Use this model if your primary task is finding sentences that are exact or close paraphrases of each other. For example, if you're building a chatbot and want to match a user's query to a list of pre-written answers, this model would excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `bert-base-nli-mean-tokens`: This model is a foundational, but now largely superseded, model in the SentenceTransformer ecosystem.\n",
    "- Training and Purpose: This was one of the first `Sentence-BERT` models released. It's based on the original `bert-base-uncased` model and was fine-tuned on the Natural Language Inference (NLI) dataset. The \"mean-tokens\" part refers to its pooling strategy, which averages the output vectors of all tokens in a sentence to create a single sentence vector.\n",
    "- Architecture & Efficiency: Because it's based on the original `BERT` model, it's significantly larger (12 layers) and outputs a 768-dimensional vector, which makes it about 2-5 times slower and larger than the MiniLM models.\n",
    "- When to use it: You generally shouldn't use this model for new projects. The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model offers better performance in most cases, is much faster, and is more efficient. This model is mainly for historical context or if you have a legacy system that already uses it."

As well as our former Education Secretary, Arne \\nDuncan. (Applause.) I want to take this time to thank you both \\npublicly for your dedication and leadership and friendship. We \\ncouldn’t do this without the support of the Department of Education \\nunder both of your leadership. So I’m grateful to you personally, \\nand very proud of all that you’ve done for this country.\\nI also want to acknowledge a few other special guests we have in the \\naudience. We’ve got a pretty awesome crew. As one of my staff \\nsaid, “You roll pretty deep.” (Laughter.) I’m like, well, yeah, we \\nhave a few good friends. We have with us today Ted Allen, La La \\nAnthony, Connie Britton, Andy Cohen — yeah, Andy Cohen is here \\n— (laughter) — Carla Hall, Coach Jim Harbaugh and his beautiful \\nwife, who’s a lot better looking than him — (laughter) — Lana \\nParrilla, my buddy Jay Pharoah, Kelly Rowland, Usher —\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Woo!\\nMRS.

And \\nhe’s really not going to like this because he tries to pretend like he \\ndoesn’t exist at all, but our Senior Advisor, Greg Darnieder. \\n(Applause.) There you go. Greg has been a leader in education his \\nentire life. I’ve known him since I was a little organizer person. And \\nit’s just been just a joy to work with you all. These individuals, they \\nare brilliant. They are creative. They have worked miracles with \\nhardly any staff or budget to speak of — which is how we roll in the \\nFirst Lady’s Office. (Laughter.)

We wanted \\nto change the conversation around what it means and what it takes \\nto be a success in this country. Because let’s be honest, if we’re \\nalways shining the spotlight on professional athletes or recording \\nartists or Hollywood celebrities, if those are the only achievements \\nwe celebrate, then why would we ever think kids would see college \\nas a priority?\\nSo we decided to flip the script and shine a big, bright spotlight on \\nall things educational. For example, we made College Signing Day a \\nnational event. We wanted to mimic all the drama and excitement \\ntraditionally reserved for those few amazing football and basketball \\nplayers choosing their college and university teams. We wanted to \\nfocus that same level of energy and attention on kids going to \\ncollege because of their academic achievements. Because as a \\nnation, that’s where the spotlight should also be — on kids who \\nwork hard in school and do the right thing when no one is watching, \\nmany beating daunting odds.\\nNext, we launched Better Make Room. It’s a social media campaign \\nto give young people the support and inspiration they need to \\nactually complete higher education. And to really drive that message \\nhome, you may recall that I debuted my music career — (laughter) \\n— rapping with Jay about getting some knowledge by going to \\ncollege. (Laughter and applause.)\\nWe are also very proud of all that this administration has done to \\nmake higher education more affordable. We doubled investments in \\nPell grants and college tax credits. We expanded income-based loan \\nrepayment options for tens of millions of students. We made it \\neasier to apply for financial aid. We created a College Scorecard to \\nhelp students make good decisions about higher education. And we \\nprovided new funding and support for school counselors. \\n(Applause.) Altogether, we made in this administration the largest \\ninvestment in higher education since the G.I. Bill. (Applause.)

In fact, a recent study showed that students who met with a \\nschool counselor to talk about financial aid or college were three \\ntimes more likely to attend college, and they were nearly seven \\ntimes more likely to apply for financial aid.\\nSo our school counselors are truly among the heroes of the Reach \\nHigher story. And that’s why we created this event two years ago, \\nbecause we thought that they should finally get some recognition. \\n(Applause.) We wanted everyone to know about the difference that \\nthese phenomenal men and women have been making in the lives of \\nour young people every day. And our 2017 School Counselor of the \\nYear, Terri Tchorzynski, is a perfect example.\\nAs you heard, Terri works at the Calhoun Area Career Center, a \\ncareer and technical education school in Michigan. And here’s what \\nTerri’s principal said about her in his letter of recommendation. He \\nsaid, “Once she identifies a systemic need, she works tirelessly to \\naddress it.”\\nSo when students at Terri’s school reported feeling unprepared to \\napply for higher education, Terri sprang into action to create a \\nschool-wide, top-to-bottom college-readiness effort. Under Terri’s \\nleadership, more students than ever before attended workshops on \\nresume writing, FAFSA completion — yes, I can now say FAFSA \\n— (laughter) — and interview preparation. I can barely say it. \\n(Laughter.) They did career and personal — personality \\nassessments. They helped plan a special college week. And they \\norganized a Military Day, hosting recruiters from all branches of our \\narmed forces. And because of these efforts, today, 75 percent of \\nCalhoun’s seniors now complete key college application steps, and \\nTerri’s school has won state and national recognition.\\nAnd all of this is just one small part of what Terri does for her \\nstudents each day.

She helped me with my doubts and \\ninsecurities.” She said, my life has changed “for the better in all \\naspects.” Kyra said, “She held my hand through my hardest times.” \\nShe said, “Mrs. Tchorzynski is my lifesaver.” That’s what Kyra \\nsaid.
